Gina is a young lady that just met, according to her, the guy that puts to shame all other guys in term of ... 
everything. In her worldview, he is simply better than everyone else in terms of: hotness, height, 
muscle mass, facial symmetry, resources potential, willingness to commit, intelligence etc. Gina's chest feels like
it is beating from the flap of a million butterflies and she exultantly calls her friend, Wendy, to tell her the story
of her newfound alpha boy. They proceed to indulge in a shared romantic frenzy and all is well and good in girly 
romance town. Altough Gina *genuinely* believes that this all happend because this guy is special she, to put it
bluntly, is wrong and perhaps even delusional about the whole affair. 

Let us examine why.

.. TEASER_END

Firstable, Ggina has a few hard held assumptions about her tingles:

1. This guy sees something special in me. That is why we clicked!
2. We are so very similar to each other, we see things the same way!
3. bla bla bla

Does that make sense? It's plausible
