If you are anything like me, you have in your head a certain model, or 
worldview, through wich you perceive and analyse the events in your daily life.
If you question yourself and refer to this worldview, you will find that it 
has a *rational* explanation for most anything that happens to you. What I 
mean is that you would be hard pressed, for example, to find anyone who can 
not come up with at least a basic answer to the following questions:

1. Why do you love your husband ?
2. Why did you become a doctor ?
3. Why do you think that stealing is wrong ?

Pondering on these toy questions for a while and answering them will leave you 
with a feeling of being certain that there is a *rational reason*, or cause, 
for you to hold a particular opinion. This is an integral part of what
we consider to be our *self*. It is part of our identity and, essentially, 
defines who we are as a person.

But what if I told you that this sense of self, that this coherent worldview 
and perception of reality is actually a lie ? That a part of your brain 
constantly changes reality slightly before showing it to *you* ?  In other 
words, what if i told you that the *perception* you have of reality is, from 
moment to moment, rearranged into a more convenient picture (which might or 
might not be based on physical reality) before you can make any decisions on 
how you act?

Not only am I telling you that this is exactly the case, I am also telling you 
that I can proove it by performing with you the world's simplest neuroscience 
experiment ever devised by scientists. 

If you are ready to be a lab test subject, follow me along ...

The simplest neuroscience experiment ever devised
-------------------------------------------------
To conduct my mind shattering neuro experiment, you will need:

1. Your right hand.
2. Your nose.

Experimental protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Firstable, take your right hand and raise it in front of your face
with the palm facing towards your body. Then, take the thumb
of that hand and approach it to the tip of your nose until they touch. At the 
moment of touching, I want you to answer the following question:
what is the time delay between the feeling of touch on your thumb and on
your nose?

Discussion and results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OK folks, in the interest of science, I have conducted this experiment in all 
possible variation you can imagine: with head upside down, underwater, naked, 
on a hot air ballon, with a blood alcool content of 0.08 g/dl and, the result
is always the same: there is **zero** time lag between the feeling on the thumb
and the nose; it is always felt simulteanously.

But think about it and you will realise that it is *impossible*. This cannot
be what happened in the physical world. This is why: Sense of touch happens 
when signal is carried by the nervous system from your skin to your brain. The 
total distance that this signal must travel is greater when starting from the 
thumb then from the nose. Therefore, the signal from your nose arrives in your 
brain first and the signal from your thumb arrives second; not simultanously, 
as our feeling indicates.

It would appear then that reality has been *modified* before it is presented 
to us. Ok, very well, but who is this highjacker ? what actually happened ? Do
we know? Yes, turns out that labcoat people have figured this out and they 
have an explanation. Enters the left brain interpreter.

The Left Brain Interpreter
--------------------------
Now this is were it starts to get interesting. Michael 
S. Gazzaniga, a neuroscientist who works at the University of California, 
Santa Barbara, has discovered that there is a part of your brain called he 
calls "the Left Brain Interpreter" (A.K.A: The Brain Bullshit Headquarter) 
whose only task is to construct contrived version of reality that are then 
force fed into your conciousness. That's right people, let that sink in for a 
moment: there is a pile of neurons, somewhere in your head, whose only purpose 
is to present to you a FALSE version of reality. God help us!

Anyone who has been around your basic off the shelf homo sapien for more then 
10 minutes is only midly surprised by these findings. I would be ready to bet
my left nut that the cumulative quantity of bullshit that is uttered by 
humanity in general ranges into the 10's of zettabytes per seconds. So really,
nothing too ground breaking here.
